This project is a demonstration of using the **.NET Core Healthchecks API** in a C# console application. The application performs a simple test to check the health of external APIs as well as the built-in tests of an ASP.NET Core application.

The external API test involves reaching out to an API endpoint and verifying that it can be accessed and data is returned. Additionally, the application includes a healthcheck for an ASP.NET Core application, leveraging the built-in health tests provided by the framework.

The purpose of this project is to provide a simple, yet robust example of how to implement healthchecks in a **.NET Core application**. The demonstration of using both external APIs and built-in ASP.NET Core tests showcases the versatility and power of the **Healthchecks API**, making it a valuable tool for ensuring the reliability and stability of your applications.
